## Datatypes in Java

Understood and implemented fundamental data types in Java to create main functions and associated methods


## Arrays in Java

Branch description:
1. BinSort.java - Performed binary search and agnostic binary search on sorted java integer arrays.
2. arrSortReverse.java - Created arrays for swapping and searching integer arrays using methods.
3. RowColMatrix.java - Created a 2d integer array and performed linear search for target element.
4. sortedMat.java - Created a 2d integer array sorted in ascending order and performed binary search for target element.
5. Mainbubsort.java - Implemented bubble sort algorithm on integer array.

## Searching Algorithms

1. Used Binary Search to return index of target element in sorted Integer array.
